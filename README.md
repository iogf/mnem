~~~

When mnem doesn't find one of the parameters -i -m, -y, -u, -d it assumes the current values 
for years, minutes, days etc. When it finds these parameters and they aren't followed by
values then it assumes all possible values for the given parameter.

So, if you run the following command:

    mnem -a 'This is a note' -u -i 40

It will assume years=current, months=current, days=current, hours=[1, 2, 3, ...24], minutes=40.
That means it will display 'This is a note' the amount (24 - current-hour) in the current day.

**Display a note daily**

    mnem -a 'it will be shown every day until the end of the month.' -d  

**Display a note monthly**
  
    mnem -a 'Title It is a message.' -m 

The above command will assume days=current, years=current, minutes=current.
So, the message above will be displayed every month in the same time of the day
that the command was issued.

**Display a note monthly on a specific day**
  
    mnem -a 'Testing' -m -d 1 
  

The above command tells mnem to display the note in the first day of each month along the
current year.

**Display a note daily at a specific time**
  
    mnem -a 'Cool note.' -m  -d  -r 15 -e 30 
    
    
**Display a note on a specific date**

    
    mnem -a 'this is a note.' -y 2016 2018 -m 3 -u 10 -i 44 -d 18

It will display a note when it is 18/03/2016 at 10:44 am. and when it is
18/03/2018 at 10:44 too.

**Find notes**

    mnem -f 'somestring'

It finds all set of notes that contains 'somestring' in. You can also combine the 
letter doubled arguments -ii, -mm, -uu, -yy, -dd to perform searches in the mnem database.

Like in:

    mnem -f 'somestring' -ii 20 -dd 20

That would find all notes that contain 'somestring' and are going to be displayed at a datetime
like YY:MM:20 HH:20:SS.

**Delete notes**

The following command can be issued in order to delte a note.

    mnem -r NOTE_ID

However it is also possible to mix parameters like -mm, -dd, -yy etc to delete notes
that match the desired pattern. The variant --remove or -r accepts the same parameters as
the command variant -f or --find.

Thus.

    mnem -r 'Cool' -m 6

Would delete all notes whose note msg contains the string 'Cool' and its displaying month is 6.
